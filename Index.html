         <p><strong>Water</strong> level in Rangamati's Kaptai Lake is rising due to heavy rainfall for past four days, 
            resulting in a significant increase in power generation. Currently, all five units of the Kaptai Hydroelectric Power Plant (KHPP) are is operation.
            The units are collectively producing <mark>135 MW</mark> of electricity per day, all of which is being 
            transmitted to the national grid.Meanwhile, the onrush of water from the upstream has contributed to the rise of the lake's water level.<mark> <u>Superintendent Engineer</u> </mark> of Karnafuli Hydroelectric 
            Power Station ATM Abduz Zaher said that the increased water level in Kaptai Lake was the direct result
            of heavy rainfall in the region over the past few days.According to the Rule Curve data, Kaptai Lake was
            initially expected <i>to reach 90.60 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL) on August 6<sup>th</sup> </i>. However, the current water level has reached 82.90 feet MSL.
            Engineer ATM Abduz Zaher also said that further increase in water level will lead to a proportional rise in power generation. CAPS Founding Chairman Prof Ahmad Kamruzzaman Majumder said use of renewable energy plays an important role in both air quality and energy development.
            <strong>Fossil fuel</strong> use is constantly increasing the amount of greenhouse gas emission, which can cause massive deterioration of air quality, he said.
            Increasing use of renewable energy and reducing fossil fuel dependency can be an effective solution to address challenges related to air quality, he added.
            Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (Bapa) <mark>Joint Secretary Mihir Biswas </mark> urged the government's power division and Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority to promote renewable energy in the country.
            Dominic Sentu Gomes, technical coordinator (urban programme) ofWorld Vision Bangladesh, said living in clean air is the right of every people and that it is the government's responsibility to ensure this.
            State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid today said that the next two years would be critical for the energy and power sector of the country.He said the country needs to 
            leapfrog during this time to fulfil the increasing demand and ensure energy security.<strong>"We need to increase our local gas production by 600 mmcfd …will start building a pipeline from Bhola to Khulna, 
            and replace all the old pipelines in Dhaka and Narayanganj to make them automated…"</strong> he added, stating that it would be a huge challenge.
            The state minister was addressing a seminar titled, "Highest Utilisation of Natural Resources of Bangladesh:Philosophy of Bangabandhu", by Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce & Industries (FBCCI) at its office in Motijheel.
